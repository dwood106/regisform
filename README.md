OVERVIEW

This is a follow along project from freeCodeCamp.com. Although I followed it through a step by step tutorial, I still am proud of it. I have been learning html and css for 2 weeks now, and this was the first time during a project that I was able to figure it out without looking things up. I am well aware that it is far from where I want to be, but I look at it as a good step in a positive direction. The more I can follow along with these tutorials and see what they focus on, and how they sort their html, or the order they do their css in, I will hopefully be able to quickly apply it when making my own websites.

So I do not take credit for this work other than I solved all the problems I was faced with, I typed in all of the code, and gained more confidence in my coding abilities.

Thank you for taking the time to stop by, and I suggest you stop by again in the future, because it only gets better from here.
